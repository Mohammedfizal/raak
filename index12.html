        Chemistry is the study of a range of matter such as atoms, crystals, molecules. It also involves the concepts of energy and entropy that are related to the spontaneity of various chemical processes. The course helps the students in improving their diverse skills in various areas such as laboratory skills, numerical and computing skills, ability to approach to the problems both analytically and logically, time management skills, etc. Since this is a branch of natural sciences, it is commonly known as “The Science of Matter.”

The chemicals are used in almost every field such as medicines, food products, electronics and even in construction activities. This creates many opportunities for the chemistry graduates in diverse fields. The entry level jobs in this field usually require at least the bachelor’s degree in chemistry, but majority of the jobs like research needs candidates with PhD  in the same.
